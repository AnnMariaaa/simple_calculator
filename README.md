# SIMPLE CALCULATOR

## Description:
For my final project in the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course, I built a simple calculator using Python and Tkinter library for the GUI application. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with additional functionalities like square and inverse.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- This project necessitates that tkinter, a library in Python used for implement GUI applications, may be pip installed using:
    > pip install tk

## Features:
-  **Basic Operations:** The calculator is capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
-  **Inverse Functionality:** Quickly find the reciprocal of any number with the press of a button.
-  **Square Functionality:** The calculator also enables easy calculation of the square of a number

## Error Handling
-  **Division by Zero:** The calculator also handles division by zero errors by detecting when the user attempts to divide any number by zero and providing an appropriate error message.
-  **Decimal Handling:** Consecutive decimal dots after the whole number or placing decimal dots after the fraction part are not allowed. Additionally, the calculator ensures proper decimal placement to avoid confusion and inaccuracies in calculations.
-  **Keyboard Input Disallowed:** To maintain accuracy and prevent input errors, the calculator disallows keyboard input and relies solely on the calculator keys for user interaction.
- **Incomplete Expression:** The calculator ensures that an expression is complete before evaluating it, preventing errors caused by incomplete input.
